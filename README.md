# Simple Rust Server
This is a very simple implementation of the rust game server using steamcmd

## Build
First thing is to build the container, I am tagging it with the name rust
```docker build . -t rust```

## Start
Make sure you have a directory called `data` where you launch the following command

Run the command `docker-compose up -d`
